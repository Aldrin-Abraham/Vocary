# Vocary - Vocal Analyzer üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Resonators


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Aldrin Abraham - SSET

### Project Description
Vocary has evolved into a comprehensive vocal analysis platform that offers multiple tools for singers, voice actors, and audio enthusiasts. Beyond just voice similarity comparison, it now provides detailed insights into pitch accuracy, timbre characteristics, vocal range, and emotional expression.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever found yourself:
- Singing in the shower and just knowing you sound exactly like Ariana Grande (you don't)?
- Arguing with friends about who does a better Ed Sheeran impression (it's neither of you)?
- Wondering if your voice could classify as ASMR or should be classified as a war crime?
- Curious if your vocal fry makes you sound sexy or just sleep-deprived?

Most rational humans don't lose sleep over these questions. But for you, our delightfully unhinged user, we've built the ultimate tool for your vocal vanity (or humiliation).


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Vocary has evolved from a simple similarity checker to a full-blown vocal narcissism enabler. Our upgraded system now offers:

1. Celebrity Delusion Meter: Still compares your voice to famous singers, but now with more ways to crush your dreams (or fuel your fantasy).

2. Pitch Police: Visual proof that yes, you were totally off-key during the chorus. Includes helpful "yikes" annotations.

3. Timbre Tattletale: Reveals whether your voice sounds "sultry jazz singer" or "teenager going through puberty."

4. Emotion Exposer: Claims you were singing passionately when really you were just yelling at your cat.

5. Vocal Autopsy: Detailed breakdown of everything wrong with your voice, served with colorful charts to soften the blow.

Using questionable AI, dubiously accurate algorithms, and absolutely zero licensed music samples, we provide:
- Percentage scores that may or may not be made up
- Feedback that's 20% science and 80% savage
- Beautiful visualizations to distract from your mediocre talent
- Shareable results so you can subject friends to this nonsense too

It's like getting roasted by Simon Cowell, but in JSON format and with more glitter.
